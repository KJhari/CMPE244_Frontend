# IoT-Based Motor Control with ChatGPT Integration

## Description
This project is an IoT-based motor control system that integrates with ChatGPT for interactive operation. It allows users to control motor functions through a web-based interface and get responses from a ChatGPT-like model for queries related to the motor control operations.

## Features
- Angular frontend for user interaction.
- FastAPI backend for handling motor control logic and ChatGPT interaction.
- Responsive design for ease of use across various devices.
- Mocked ChatGPT responses for demonstration purposes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/)
- Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Angular CLI (Install via `npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd path/to/backend`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the FastAPI server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

### Frontend Setup
